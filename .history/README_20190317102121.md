Looking at the project structure:

Client (Ants/client)
    components

        This contains the reusable components like header, footer, table, search. These are standalone components that can be used by any pages by passing required props.

    containers

        This contains the Application container, App.jsx that embeds all the required components to design the page. The application has;
        - header
        - table to list the Ad slots
        - form to show the Ad details and create, edit

    service

        This is common api layer that uses 'axios' library to make server calls

Server (Ants/server)
    server.js

        This is the main entry point for the server code and contains all the REST end points required by the client
        
    entities

        This contains the schemas for handling mongodb models
        
For Database, Mongo is used as a service through https://www.mlab.com/
